# Create README file

  ## Overview
The provided Node.js code constitutes a basic command-line application designed to facilitate the generation of README files for GitHub repositories. Utilizing modules such as inquirer for user prompts and fs for file system operations, the application prompts users for key details about their repository, including repository name, GitHub username, email address, project overview, and the license being used. Upon receiving user input, the program dynamically generates markdown content through the generateMarkdown module and asynchronously writes this content to a 'README.md' file.
